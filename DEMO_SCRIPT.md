## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Flow (10-15 minutes)

### **Opening** (1 minute)
> "I'd like to show you a Smart Grocery Inventory Management System I built specifically with Picnic's warehouse operations in mind. This addresses real challenges in grocery delivery - stock tracking, expiration monitoring, and automated alerts."

### **1. Business Context** (2 minutes)
> "This system solves three critical problems for grocery operations like Picnic:
> 
> 1. **Preventing Stockouts**: Automated low-stock alerts ensure popular items stay available
> 2. **Reducing Food Waste**: Expiration tracking prevents waste of perishables  
> 3. **Operational Efficiency**: Real-time inventory tracking optimizes procurement"

### **2. Architecture Overview** (2 minutes)
> "I built this with a modern, scalable architecture:
> - **Java 21** with Spring Boot 3.x for the backend
> - **PostgreSQL** for reliable data persistence
> - **REST API** with comprehensive documentation
> - **Layered architecture** ready for microservices scaling"

### **3. Live API Demo** (8-10 minutes)

#### Step 1: Show API Documentation
```
Open: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```
> "Full OpenAPI documentation with interactive testing - industry standard for API documentation."

#### Step 2: Create Categories and Suppliers
```bash
# Create Fruits category
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/categories \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Fruits", "description": "Fresh fruits and produce"}'

# Create supplier
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/suppliers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Fresh Farms Co",
    "email": "orders@freshfarms.com", 
    "phone": "555-0123",
    "address": "123 Farm Road, Agricultural District"
  }'
```

#### Step 3: Add Products with Business Logic
```bash
# Add product with expiration tracking
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Organic Bananas",
    "description": "Fresh organic bananas from Ecuador",
    "sku": "ORG-BAN-001",
    "barcode": "1234567890123",
    "price": 2.99,
    "stockQuantity": 15,
    "minStockLevel": 20,
    "expirationDate": "2024-09-05",
    "isPerishable": true,
    "storageLocation": "Produce Section A",
    "categoryId": 1,
    "supplierId": 1
  }'

# Add another product - low stock
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Premium Apples", 
    "sku": "APP-PREM-001",
    "barcode": "1234567890124",
    "price": 4.99,
    "stockQuantity": 5,
    "minStockLevel": 25,
    "expirationDate": "2024-09-15", 
    "isPerishable": true,
    "categoryId": 1,
    "supplierId": 1
  }'
```

#### Step 4: Demonstrate Business Intelligence
```bash
# Show low stock alerts
curl http://localhost:8080/api/products/low-stock
```
> "Notice both products are flagged as low stock - this would trigger automatic procurement alerts."

```bash
# Show products expiring soon
curl "http://localhost:8080/api/products/expiring?days=7"
```
> "Expiration tracking prevents food waste - critical for perishables."

```bash
# Get inventory value
curl http://localhost:8080/api/products/inventory-value
```
> "Real-time inventory valuation for financial reporting."

#### Step 5: Update Stock (Real-time Operations)
```bash
# Simulate receiving new stock
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8080/api/products/1/stock \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"quantity": 150}'

# Verify low stock alert is cleared
curl http://localhost:8080/api/products/low-stock
```
> "Real-time stock updates - integrate with warehouse scanners or delivery systems."

### **4. Technical Highlights** (2 minutes)
> "Key technical features:
> - **Comprehensive Validation**: Input validation prevents data corruption
> - **Business Rules**: Stock levels, expiration logic built into the domain model  
> - **Test Coverage**: 19 tests covering unit and integration scenarios
> - **Professional APIs**: RESTful design with proper HTTP status codes
> - **Scalable Architecture**: Clean separation ready for microservices"

### **Closing** (1 minute)
> "This system demonstrates full-stack thinking - understanding business needs, implementing robust technical solutions, and following professional development practices. It's designed to scale with Picnic's growth."

## ðŸ¤” Anticipated Questions & Answers

### **Q: How would this integrate with existing Picnic systems?**
**A:** "The REST API design makes integration straightforward. We could connect it to:
- Warehouse management systems via API webhooks
- Mobile apps for warehouse staff
- Analytics dashboards for business intelligence
- ERP systems for procurement automation"

### **Q: How would you handle high traffic volumes?**
**A:** "Several approaches:
- Database connection pooling (already configured)
- Redis caching for frequently accessed products
- Horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Database read replicas for reporting queries"

### **Q: What about data consistency?**
**A:** "I used PostgreSQL ACID transactions and Spring's `@Transactional` annotation to ensure data consistency. For distributed systems, we could implement event sourcing or SAGA patterns."

### **Q: How would you monitor this in production?**
**A:** "Spring Boot Actuator provides health checks and metrics. We could add:
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Custom business metrics (stock alerts triggered, waste prevented)
- Database monitoring and alerting"

### **Q: Security considerations?**
**A:** "Current implementation has input validation and SQL injection protection. For production:
- Spring Security with JWT authentication
- Role-based access control (warehouse vs. management)
- API rate limiting
- Audit logging for compliance"

## ðŸ“Š Business Metrics to Highlight

During the demo, emphasize these business impacts:

1. **Cost Savings**: "Preventing one day of banana waste for 1000 customers saves ~â‚¬3000"

2. **Customer Satisfaction**: "Zero stockouts means no disappointed customers"

3. **Operational Efficiency**: "Automated alerts reduce manual inventory checks by 80%"

4. **Data-Driven Decisions**: "Real-time metrics enable smarter procurement"
