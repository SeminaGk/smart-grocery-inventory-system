## 🧠 Technical Questions & Detailed Answers

### **1. Spring Boot & Framework Questions**

#### Q: "Why did you choose Spring Boot for this project?"
**Your Answer:**
> "I chose Spring Boot 3.x for several strategic reasons:
> - **Production Ready**: Auto-configuration, embedded server, health checks out-of-the-box
> - **Ecosystem**: Massive ecosystem with Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Spring Cloud
> - **Industry Standard**: Picnic uses Spring, so it aligns with your tech stack
> - **Developer Experience**: Annotations like `@RestController`, `@Service` reduce boilerplate
> - **Testing Support**: Excellent test framework integration with `@SpringBootTest`
> 
> The auto-configuration was particularly valuable - PostgreSQL integration, JPA setup, and web server configuration happened automatically."

#### Q: "Explain the difference between @Component, @Service, and @Repository"
**Your Answer:**
> "All are stereotype annotations that make classes Spring beans, but they serve different architectural purposes:
> - **@Repository**: Data access layer, enables Spring's exception translation
> - **@Service**: Business logic layer, contains domain operations  
> - **@Component**: Generic bean, used for utility classes
> 
> In my project:
> - `ProductService` uses `@Service` - it contains business rules like stock validation
> - `ProductRepository` extends `JpaRepository` - Spring automatically creates the implementation
> - This layered approach makes testing easier and code more maintainable."

### **2. Database & JPA Questions**

#### Q: "How did you handle database relationships?"
**Your Answer:**
> "I implemented three key relationships:
> 
> **Product → Category (Many-to-One):**
> ```java
> @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
> @JoinColumn(name = "category_id")
> private Category category;
> ```
> 
> **Product → Supplier (Many-to-One):**
> Similar pattern for supplier relationships.
> 
> **Category → Products (One-to-Many):**
> ```java
> @OneToMany(mappedBy = "category", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
> private List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();
> ```
> 
> Key decisions:
> - **Lazy Loading**: Prevents N+1 queries, better performance
> - **Cascade Operations**: Deleting a category handles child products
> - **Foreign Keys**: Database-level referential integrity"

#### Q: "How would you optimize database queries?"
**Your Answer:**
> "I implemented several optimization strategies:
> 
> **1. Custom Queries:**
> ```java
> @Query(\"SELECT p FROM Product p WHERE p.stockQuantity <= p.minStockLevel\")
> List<Product> findLowStockProducts();
> ```
> 
> **2. Indexes:** Added on frequently queried fields (SKU, barcode)
> 
> **3. Lazy Loading:** Prevents unnecessary data fetching
> 
> **4. Projection Queries:** For reports, only select needed columns
> 
> **For scale:** Connection pooling, read replicas, query result caching with Redis."

### **3. API Design Questions**

#### Q: "Why did you choose REST over GraphQL?"
**Your Answer:**
> "REST was the right choice for this inventory system because:
> - **Simplicity**: CRUD operations map naturally to HTTP verbs
> - **Caching**: HTTP caching works well for product data
> - **Team Familiarity**: REST is more widely understood
> - **Tooling**: Excellent tooling (Swagger, Postman) for testing
> 
> GraphQL would be better for:
> - Complex data relationships
> - Mobile apps needing flexible queries
> - Multiple client types with different data needs"

#### Q: "How did you handle validation?"
**Your Answer:**
> "Multi-layered validation approach:
> 
> **1. Input Validation (DTO level):**
> ```java
> @NotBlank(message = \"Product name is required\")
> @Size(min = 2, max = 100)
> private String name;
> ```
> 
> **2. Business Logic Validation (Service level):**
> ```java
> if (productRepository.findBySku(sku).isPresent()) {
>     throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"SKU already exists\");
> }
> ```
> 
> **3. Database Constraints:**
> - Unique constraints on SKU/barcode
> - Foreign key constraints
> - Check constraints for positive prices
> 
> This prevents invalid data at every layer."

### **4. Architecture & Design Questions**

#### Q: "Explain your layered architecture"
**Your Answer:**
> "I used a clean 4-layer architecture:
> 
> **Controller Layer:** REST endpoints, HTTP handling, request/response transformation
> **Service Layer:** Business logic, transaction management, orchestration
> **Repository Layer:** Data access, query implementation
> **Model Layer:** Domain entities, business rules, relationships
> 
> **Benefits:**
> - **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a single responsibility
> - **Testability**: Can mock each layer independently
> - **Maintainability**: Changes in one layer don't cascade
> - **Scalability**: Easy to extract services into microservices later"

#### Q: "How would you scale this for millions of products?"
**Your Answer:**
> "Several scaling strategies:
> 
> **Database Level:**
> - Partitioning by category or supplier
> - Read replicas for reporting queries
> - Connection pooling and query optimization
> 
> **Application Level:**
> - Redis caching for frequently accessed products
> - Separate read/write services (CQRS pattern)
> - Horizontal scaling with load balancers
> 
> **Architecture Level:**
> - Extract into microservices (Product Service, Inventory Service, etc.)
> - Event-driven architecture with Kafka
> - API Gateway for routing and rate limiting"

### **5. Testing Questions**

#### Q: "Explain your testing strategy"
**Your Answer:**
> "I implemented a comprehensive testing pyramid:
> 
> **Unit Tests (11 tests):** 
> - Test service logic in isolation
> - Mock external dependencies
> - Fast execution, run frequently
> 
> **Integration Tests (8 tests):**
> - Test full request/response cycle
> - Real database interactions with H2
> - MockMvc for web layer testing
> 
> **Test Coverage:**
> - Business logic: Stock validation, expiration checking
> - Edge cases: Duplicate SKUs, negative quantities
> - API contracts: Request/response formats
> 
> **For production:** Add contract tests, performance tests, chaos engineering."

## 🎯 Behavioral Questions & Answers

### Q: "Tell me about a challenging technical problem you solved"
**Your Answer:**
> "The most challenging part was designing the inventory alerting system. I needed to balance real-time accuracy with performance.
> 
> **The Problem:** How to efficiently identify products needing attention (low stock, expiring soon) without constantly scanning the entire database.
> 
> **My Solution:**
> 1. **Smart Queries**: Instead of checking every product, I wrote targeted queries
> 2. **Business Logic in Entities**: Added `isLowStock()` method to Product class
> 3. **Flexible Time Windows**: Parameterized expiration checking (7 days, 30 days)
> 
> **Result:** System can handle thousands of products while providing instant alerts. This would prevent stockouts and reduce food waste for Picnic's operations."

### Q: "How do you approach learning new technologies?"
**Your Answer:**
> "I follow a structured learning approach:
> 1. **Understand the Why**: Learn the problem the technology solves
> 2. **Build Real Projects**: Like this inventory system - not just tutorials
> 3. **Read Documentation**: Official docs, then community resources
> 4. **Practice Deliberately**: Focus on areas where I'm weak
> 
> For this project, I dove deep into Spring Boot 3.x new features, learned advanced JPA querying, and studied REST API best practices. I'm excited about Picnic's Tech Academy - structured learning with real projects is exactly how I learn best."

### Q: "Why do you want to work at Picnic?"
**Your Answer:**
> "Three main reasons:
> 
> **1. Technical Growth**: Your Tech Academy and mentorship program show real investment in junior developers. I want to learn from experienced engineers while contributing immediately.
> 
> **2. Business Impact**: Grocery delivery affects millions of people daily. Building systems that help families get fresh food efficiently is meaningful work.
> 
> **3. Technical Excellence**: Your tech stack (Java 21, Spring 6, cloud-native) and open-source culture show you value quality engineering. I want to work where technical excellence matters.
> 
> This inventory project shows I understand your domain and can contribute to warehouse efficiency from day one."
