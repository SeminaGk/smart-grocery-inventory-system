## 🎯 Application Strategy

### **For Picnic Application:**

#### **Cover Letter Integration:**
```
I'm excited to apply for the Junior Java Developer role at Picnic. To demonstrate my readiness, I built a Smart Grocery Inventory Management System using your exact tech stack - Java 21, Spring Boot 3.x, and PostgreSQL.

This system addresses real challenges in grocery operations:
- Prevents food waste through expiration tracking
- Reduces stockouts with automated alerts  
- Optimizes warehouse efficiency with real-time data

The project showcases enterprise-level practices including comprehensive testing (19 tests), clean architecture, and production-ready APIs. I specifically designed it for grocery delivery operations like Picnic's.
